# sorting-algorithms
This repository contains implementations of three sorting algorithms: insertion, bubble, and selection sort. The purpose of the codebase is to determine the efficiency of these algorithms as measured by wall clock time.

To get started with the code, download the repository and navigate to the working directory. Compile the code with `javac EfficiencyTest.java` and run with `java EfficiencyTest`. The program will output information in the following format:
`sorting algorithm   runtime   # elements   status`
